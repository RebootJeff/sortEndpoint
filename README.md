# Usage

### Run the App
Type `gulp` in the terminal. Gulp will then watch for changes in source files and restart the server as necessary.

If there are issues with source code not reaching the client, try cleaning out the public files and re-compiling them with the following terminal commands: `gulp clean` followed by `gulp compile`.

### Run the front-end unit tests
Type `karma start` in the terminal.

### Run the back-end unit tests
Type `jasmine-node server` in the terminal.
